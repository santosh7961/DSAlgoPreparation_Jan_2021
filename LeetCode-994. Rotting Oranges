Q1. https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/
In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

Solution: You have to collect all the rotten oranges and it will rot the adjacent orages in all the four directions. So, collect the indexes of the rotten orages in the queue
and number of fresh oranges. Do the BFS, take each rotten orages and check all the four directions, if it is fresh orange, make it rottnen and add the index in the queue for 
next iteration.
